                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I work with financially-savvy millennials, like you. The only problem is they are intimidated by the stock market, and are missing out building wealth through investing. Instead, they watch their hard-earned dollars sit in savings accounts, earning little to no interest. You deserve to enjoy great returns on your money, receive steady passive income, and create lifetime wealth and financial security for yourself. The Master Class Money program teaches you how. </p>
                        <p>Most young people know that the stock market is the best place to invest money in order to create lifetime wealth.

But they’re scared.

Many of us came of age during the Financial Crash of 2008, where we watched family, friends, and strangers alike lose their live savings in the stock market. What many don’t know, however, is that the market has not only since recovered, but hit all new highs.

<a class="para" href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/09/investing/american-stock-ownership/" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send','event','CNN Money Link','Clicks');">Yet barely half of all people invest</a>.

The most common reasons people cite for not investing are:</p>

<ul class="para">
    <li class="coin">“I don’t have enough money”</li><li class="coin">“The stock market is too risky”</li><li class="coin">“Investing is too complicated for me to learn”</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what divides the poor from the rich. All wealthy people invest. What’s more, they understand that the best way to stay wealthy, and grow even wealthier, is to use money to make more money. That’s what investing is.

You can invest safely and profitably in the stock market to:</p>

            <p>My name is Bridget, and I’ve been writing about personal finance for nearly 5 years on <a class="para" href="http://moneyaftergraduation.com/" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send','event','MAG Link','Clicks');">Money After Graduation</a>, which has featured in Business Insider, MoneySense, The Globe and Mail, Questrade, and more. I am passionate about helping 20-somethings and 30-somethings build wealth to fund their dreams.

When I was a new investor, I struggled to find resources that were easy to understand and written for twenty-somethings. All the books out there were either overly-technical or geared towards investors in their 50’s and 60’s. After three years of DIY-investing in my portfolio with many wins and losses, I went back to school for an MBA, specializing in Finance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="unit full">
                <p>In my MBA program I studied macro- and micro-economic trends that impact global stock markets. I learned how to use financial derivatives like stock options to mitigate investment risk. I analyzed balance sheet after balance sheet to identify companies that are good for investment, and those that are not.

I was trained to manage a hedgefund, but now I want to bring a superior level of financial literacy to the masses. I want to teach millennials to invest — safely, profitably, and with confidence.

The stock market is exciting. Investing is fun. But like any skill, it takes time to learn how to do it well. My MBA in Finance took tens of thousands of dollars and two years of full-time study to earn, but I want everyone to reap the benefits.

<strong>My goal is to make millennials rich. Especially you.</strong></p>

                <h2 id="e-course">Master Class Money eCourse</h2>
                <p>The Master Class Money investing eCourse is a 12-module program that teaches you <strong>how to build a profitable investment portfolio that you can manage yourself, safely and profitably.</strong>

This program is unlike anything you’ve ever seen or experienced before — I should know, I’ve looked! This is exactly the resource I wish I had five years ago when I started investing in the stock market. Instead, I had to learn the hard way and earn an MBA in Finance before I finally honed the perfect investment strategy to grow lifetime wealth.

The unique combination of different learning materials, worksheets, and group discussions were designed to help you get exactly what you want: a portfolio that pays, and will last a lifetime.</p>

I travel a lot and having this type of flexibility is important. My progress is slow, but what I have learned is packaged in a refreshingly new, logical, and easy to understand way. I also wanted to mention that I think you’ve built a great product! I work with a training group and can appreciate how much time and energy developing your course has taken. :)”</p>

I have read up to part 5 for now and already feel a lot more confident into getting started in ETFs. I’ve been only investing in mutual funds and GICs for about 2 years now, and have been too chicken to go into stocks and ETFs. I find your eCourse to be very non BS. Which is great, I feel like every word is meaningful and had purpose and was not boring, but written in a way everyone can easily understand.”</p>
