                <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>I work with financially-savvy millennials, like you. The only problem is they are intimidated by the stock market, and missing out on building wealth through investing. Instead, they watch their hard-earned dollars sit in savings accounts, earning little to no interest. <strong>You deserve to enjoy great returns on your money, receive steady passive income, and create lifetime wealth and financial security for yourself.</strong> The Master Class Money investing program teaches you how. </p>

<p>I bet you’re dying to start investing, but some big fears are holding you back.</p>
<p>For example, do you ever… </p>

<ul class="para">
    <li class="coin">Think you don’t have enough money to invest because it seems like stock market is only for rich people?</li><li class="coin">Feel so overwhelmed by the complexity and volatility of the stock market that it takes a Finance degree to understand it?</li><li class="coin">Struggle to know how to build a portfolio that keeps your money safe while still earning great returns?</li><li class="coin">Find yourself staying on the sidelines, keeping your cash in savings accounts because you’re too scared to even try investing?</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the above sounds like you, you’re not alone. Most young people know the stock market is the best place to grow their wealth, but after coming of age during the Financial Crash of 2008, they’re too scared to invest. As a result, they go their whole lives missing out on the returns they need to become financially secure and fund the life of their dreams.</p>
<p>Imagine that, instead of working so hard for your money, you could make your money work for you.</p>
<p>You can use the stock market to create a passive income stream and build lifelong-wealth that will ensure financial security for the rest of your life, starting right now.</p>
<p>There has never been a better time to start building wealth through investing.</p>
<p>You can invest safely and profitably in the stock market to:</p>

            <div id="first-point" class="unit one-third">
            <p>1. Grow Your Wealth (even if you’re starting with as little as $1,000)</p>
            </div>
            <div id="second-point" class="unit one-third">
            <p>2. Create a Passive Income Stream (that pays you every single month!)</p>
            </div>
            <div id="third-point" class="unit one-third">
            <p>3. Reach Your Financial Goals (including long-term financial security!)</p>
            </div>
<br />
<p>If you ever want to reach financial freedom, you’ll need to earn more than 1% on you money in a savings account. Now is your opportunity to lay the financial foundation for the life you want, by creating an investment portfolio that earns you money and keeps your hard-earned dollars safe.</p>
<p><strong>Let me show you how.</strong></p>

            <p>My name is Bridget, and I’ve been writing about personal finance for nearly 5 years on <a class="para" href="http://moneyaftergraduation.com/" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send','event','MAG Link','Clicks');">Money After Graduation</a>, which has featured in Business Insider, MoneySense, The Globe and Mail, Questrade, and more. I am passionate about helping 20-somethings and 30-somethings build wealth to fund their dreams.

When I was a new investor, I struggled to find resources that were easy to understand and written for millennials. All the books out there were either overly-technical or geared towards investors in their 50’s and 60’s. After three years of DIY-investing in my portfolio with many wins and losses, I went back to school for an MBA, specializing in Finance.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="unit full">
                <p>In my MBA program I studied macro- and micro-economic trends that impact global stock markets. I learned how to use financial derivatives like stock options to mitigate investment risk. I analyzed balance sheet after balance sheet to identify companies that are good for investment, and those that are not. I was trained to manage a hedgefund, but now I want to bring a superior level of financial literacy to the everyday investor.</p>
                <p>I teach people to invest — safely, profitably, and with confidence.</p>

<!--MASTER CLASS MONEY ECOURSE-->

                <p>Master Class Money students used to feel exactly the same way you do about investing: too intimidated by the stock market to invest, but also aware that they were missing out on something amazing.</p>
                <p>That’s how the Master Class Money program can change the way you manage your wealth forever. You will go from feeling daunted by the stock market, to feeling empowered to build the portfolio that will help you reach your dreams.</p>
                    <p>The Master Class Money investing eCourse is a 12-module program that teaches you <strong>how to build a profitable investment portfolio that you can manage yourself, safely and profitably.</strong></p>
                    <p>This is the only investing program of its kind available online. Most people have to spend years of study and tens of thousands of dollars to get a degree in Finance in order to receive the education presented in this eCourse – I should know, I’m one of them! Now after 5 years of DIY investing and an MBA specializing in Finance, I have developed the perfect investment strategies and tools for twenty- and thirty-somethings to grow lifetime wealth in the stock market.</p>
                    <p>The unique combination of different learning materials, worksheets, and group discussions provided by the Master Class Money program were designed to help you get exactly what you want: a portfolio that pays, and will last a lifetime. This course will guide you through setting financial goals, determining your risk tolerance and investor profile, provide you with exclusive members-only discussions and content to get your investing questions answered.</p>
